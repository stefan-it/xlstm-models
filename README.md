# xLSTM Models

After pretraining a lot of Transformers-based LMs (like [German DBMDZ BERT](https://github.com/dbmdz/berts), [GBERT](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.598/), [BERTurk](https://github.com/stefan-it/turkish-bert), [Italian BERT & ELECTRA](https://github.com/stefan-it/italian-bertelectra), [Ukrainian ELECTRA](https://github.com/stefan-it/ukrainian-electra), [hmBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15575), [hmTEAMS](https://github.com/stefan-it/hmTEAMS), ...) in the recent years, it is time to move on!

This repository show-cases my new upcoming xLSTM Models. Stay tuned!
